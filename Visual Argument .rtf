\f0\fs24 \cf0 I decided to do this project on Canvas since I am very familiar with this program. I decided to touch on the feelings around negative body image. All of the pictures are black and white which promote the gloomy mood. Pictures spell out the word diet but the t is in the line below because of the double meaning of having the word die in it. Eating disorders and body image often leads peoples mental health to spiral which is shown by the scribbles and pills in the back ground of the pictures. }
